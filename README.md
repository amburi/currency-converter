# Currency Converter

A small helper app for performing currency exchange rate conversions. Create a concept for a currency conversion solution app that will input the source and target currency, enter an amount and trigger the conversion from source to target. The app will display a list of conversions and current exchange rates for the selected source currency.

## API Endpoints
API Base URL: `http://localhost:8080`
* `GET /symbol` API returns a list of 3-character currency codes that are available for exchange.
* `GET /convert?from=EUR&to=INR&amount=100` API returns the conversion rate
  * Here `from` and `to` should be the 3-character currency code available for exchanges
  * and `amount` on which conversion information will be fetched and displayed

Here's the output,
```
